The Orthodox Calendar allows users to receive information about holidays, saints and their respective icons for every day of the year. Users can click on the name of the saint or the holiday to receive detailed information. They can click forward or back arrows to see the next or the previous day. There is also information about holy texts that are read in church on that particular day.

The app uses public API from http://azbyka.ru. It was made as a project to study Jetpack Compose, Hilt, testing and some other technology.

TODO: add location information with church sites, improve design and functionality.
